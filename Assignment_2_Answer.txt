1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer 1 : 
		Boolean data type values are True , False. 
		
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer 2 :
		The three types of boolean operators are and,or,not.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer 3:
	OR Truth Table
		X        Y          X OR Y
	  True     True         True
	  True     False        True
	  False    True         True
	  False    False        False
	
	AND Truth Table
		X        Y          X AND Y
	  True     True         True
	  True     False        False
	  False    True         False
	  False    False        False
	  
		

4. What are the values of the following expressions?

Answer 4: 
		(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -- False
		not (5 > 4) -- False
		(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -- True
		not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -- False
		(True and True) and (True == False) -- False
		(not False) or (not True) -- True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer 5:
	The six comparison operators are ==, (!= or <>), >, <, >=, <=
	

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Answer 6: 
	equal opearator is denoted by ==.
	Assignment operator is denoted by =.
	When we need to assign some value to a variable, that time we use assignment operator (=). For E.g a=6
	When we need to compare between 2 variables, whether they are same or not, that time we use equal operator (==). For E.g c=d

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Answer 7:
	Block 1:
		if spam == 10:
			print('eggs')
	Block 2:
		if spam > 5:
			print('bacon')
	Block 3:
		else:
			print('ham')
			print('spam')
			print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Answer 8:
	spam = input("Enter the value : ")
	if spam == "1":
		print("Hello")
	elif spam == "2":
		print("Howdy")
	else:
		print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer 9:
	CTRL + F2

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer 10:
	Continue:
		The continue statement is used to skip code within a loop for certain iterations of the loop.if there any more interations left after the skipped iteration, the program will 
		execute those iterations.
	Break:
		Break is used to come out of a loop, based on certain condition. after the program encounters the break statement, the program exits the loop and the execution control
		goes to the immediate step after the loop.
	
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer 11:
	There is no differece. In all 3 scenarios the loop will iterate from 0 till 9, increamenting the value by 1 in each iteration.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer 12:
	using for loop:
		for i in range(1, 11):
			print(i)
			
	Using while loop:
		i = 1
		while i < 11:
			print(i)
			i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
